# C-11-14-demos
<P><SPAN>Specification of the latest version of C++ ("C++11") was completed in 2011, and many compilers now offer a wealth of features from the revised language. And such features! <CODE>auto</CODE>-declared variables reduce typing drudgery and syntactic noise; Unicode, threading support, and alignment control address important functionality gaps; and rvalue references and variadic templates facilitate the creation of more efficient, more flexible libraries. The standard library gains resource-managing smart pointers, new containers, additional algorithms, support for regular expressions, and more. Altogether, C++11 offers <EM>much</EM> more than "old" C++. This intensively technical seminar introduces the most important new features in C++11 and explains how to get the most out of them.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN><BR>That's not all. A feature-complete draft of C++11's successor, "C++14", has now been adopted,&nbsp;and this course also covers select C++14 features. These include deduced function return types; reader/writer locks; and extensions to lambda expressions (<CODE>auto</CODE> and variadic parameters, generalized captures). You won't find a more up-to-date examination of the new C++ anywhere!&nbsp; </SPAN></P>

<DIV>Participants will gain: 
<UL>
<LI>Knowledge of the most important C++11 and C++14 features and how they help produce better programs.</LI>
<LI>Insights into how new features solve important problems. </LI>
<LI>Understanding of which features are useful primarily to library writers, which to class authors, and which to virtually all C++ developers. </LI>
<LI>Availability information regarding which features are available on which platforms.</LI></UL>
<P><B>Format</B>: Lecture and question/answer. There are no hands-on exercises, but participants are welcome - encouraged! - to bring computers to experiment with the material as it is presented. </P></DIV>
